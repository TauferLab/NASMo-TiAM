# NASMo-TiAM: North America Soil Moisture Dataset Derived from Time-Specific Adaptable Machine Learning Models

## Overview - About

Workflow for Generating North America Soil Moisture at 250m Dataset Derived from Time-specific Adaptable Machine Learning Models.
NASMo-TiAM 250m workflow is based on standardized input data, where all the prediction covariates are preprocessed to allocate the same temporal and spatial characteristics.
The current version of NASMo-TiAM uses Random Forest to perform surface Soil Moisture (0-5cm depth) predictions at 250m of spatial resolution on 16-day periods from mid-2002 to
December 2020 over North America. The generated data can be found in the [ORNL DAAC](https://daac.ornl.gov/CMS/guides/NASMo_TiAM_250m.html).

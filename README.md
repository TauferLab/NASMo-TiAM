# NASMo-TiAM: North America Soil Moisture Dataset Derived from Time-Specific Adaptable Machine Learning Models

## Overview - About

Workflow for Generating North America Soil Moisture at 250m Dataset Derived from Time-specific Adaptable Machine Learning Models.
NASMo-TiAM 250m workflow is based on standardized input data, where all the prediction covariates are preprocessed to allocate the same temporal and spatial characteristics.
The current version of NASMo-TiAM uses Random Forest to perform surface Soil Moisture (0-5cm depth) predictions at 250m of spatial resolution on 16-day periods from mid-2002 to
December 2020 over North America. The generated data can be found in the [ORNL DAAC](https://daac.ornl.gov/CMS/guides/NASMo_TiAM_250m.html). 

## Prerequisites and Dependencies
To run this workflow, you must have [R>4.0](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/linux/ubuntu/fullREADME.html#installing-r) and [Python>3.8](https://www.python.org/downloads/). The R packages are listed in `install/R-dependencies.R` and for Python in `install/Python-dependencies.txt`.  

## Installation
Currently, the installation is supported on Debian, and Debian-based Linux distributions. This script installs all the necessary packages (R>4, R libraries, pip, Python libraries) for your local computer.
Requirement: Debian-based Linux distributions.
```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/TauferLab/NASMo-TiAM.git
cd NASMo-TiAM/install
./install.sh
```

If you already have R>4.0 and Python>3.8 installed on your local machine, you will only need to install the dependencies by running the next commands.
```
# Install R libraries
sudo Rscript R-dependencies.R

# Install Python libraries
sudo python3 -m pip install -r Python-dependencies.txt
```
